Data set to test prediction of claim frequency in third party motor claims.

The data is from an unknown french motor insurer, published in the 'CAS Datasets' library in R (description of factors in the PDF)

The objective: Build a model to predict the number of claims (ClaimNb) expected by policy in the test dataset. Use the train dataset to train the model

Recommended structure for approach:
- Load and Clean the data
- Investigate factors
- Prepare the data for modelling
- Build/train model
- Validate/test prediction
